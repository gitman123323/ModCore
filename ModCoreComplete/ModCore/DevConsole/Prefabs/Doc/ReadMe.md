# Essential Components

To ensure the **DevConsoleCanvas** and all its features function correctly, **five key Prefabs** must be added to your scene.

> **Important:** Adding only the **DevConsoleCanvas** prefab **without its supporting components**—such as the **CommandRegistry & Manager prefab**, and **ConsoleLoggings** (which handle command registration and console output)—may cause partial or complete malfunction of the custom DevConsole.

Please make sure to include **all required Prefabs** to avoid any issues.  
*Consider this your friendly warning!* ⚠️

### Note

For guidance on which Prefabs and components to include, check out the **CompilerTestScene** in the project.  
You can inspect and copy its setup to mirror a fully functional DevConsole environment in your own scenes.
