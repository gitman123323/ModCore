# ModCoreWindow (Unity Editor Window)

## Summary
`ModCoreWindow` is a custom Unity Editor Window designed to simplify the creation of new console command scripts within the DevConsole system. It provides a UI for entering a new command class name and automatically generates a command script template in the project.

---

## Features
- Adds a menu item under **Tools > Mod Core** to open the window.
- Provides a simple UI to input the new command class name.
- Creates a new `.cs` command script with a basic template, including:
  - Command name based on the class name.
  - Default `Execute` method with safe logging.
- Prevents overwriting existing command scripts.
- Ensures the target folder structure exists, creating it if necessary.
- Refreshes the Unity Asset Database automatically after creation.

---

## Usage
1. Open Unity Editor.
2. Navigate to **Tools > Mod Core**.
3. Click **Create Command Script**.
4. Enter the desired command class name (e.g., `ClearConsoleCommand`).
5. Click **Create** to generate the new script in `Assets/ModCore/DevConsole/CommandSystem/Commands`.
6. Edit the generated script to implement your commandâ€™s functionality.

---

## Example Generated Script

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public class YourCommandName : ConsoleCommand
{
    public override string Name => "/yourcommandname";
    public override string Description => "Describe what this command does";

    public override void Execute(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            DevConsoleLogScroll.Instance.Log("<color=#DDA0DD>Hello, Dev!</color>");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            DevConsoleLogScroll.Instance.Log($"{ex.Message}", Color.red);
        }
    }
}

Additional Notes:

The command name string is automatically generated by converting the class name to lowercase and stripping "Command" suffix if present.

The system will warn if you try to create a command with an empty name or if a file with the same name already exists.

The CommandNamePromptWindow class handles the input prompt and validation.

Use this tool to maintain consistent command script structure and streamline development.

Important Reminder:
Please do not move the files used by the ModCore tool from their original locations within the project. The tool relies on predefined file paths, and relocating these files will cause the system to break or malfunction.

If you absolutely must move any files, make sure to thoroughly inspect the code for any hardcoded paths or references that may need updating to reflect the new locations. Failing to do so will result in errors and could disrupt your workflow.

For best results, keep all ModCore-related files in their original folders.
