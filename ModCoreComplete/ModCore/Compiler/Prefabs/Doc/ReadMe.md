=== Prefabs ===

You’ll find useful prefabs inside the ModCore/Compiler/Prefabs folder:

Mr.Compiler – The live compiler and UI interface.

ModLoaders – Contains both MonoBehaviourLoader and ModLoader, which handle loading mods at runtime.

These are already set up in the CompilerTestScene. It's recommended to copy everything from that scene into your own rather than drag prefabs manually, unless something is missing or you know what you're doing.
