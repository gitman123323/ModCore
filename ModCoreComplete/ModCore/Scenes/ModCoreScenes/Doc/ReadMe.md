=== Test Scenes ===

These scenes are provided as reference setups to help you integrate and configure all necessary components in your own scenes.

You’re encouraged to use the CompilerTestScene as a template — simply copy and paste everything from it into your own scene, and then remove anything you don’t need. This ensures all critical components are properly placed and configured.

The prefabs in ModCore/Compiler/Prefabs exist only in case you want to add things manually or if something is missing after copying from the test scene. Manual setup is possible, but not recommended unless you know what you’re doing.

Feel free to rename the test scenes to match your own naming style — they’re just there to get you started quickly.
