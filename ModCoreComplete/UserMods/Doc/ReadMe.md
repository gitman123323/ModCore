=== Mod Files ===

These mod files are here for testing and experimentation â€” feel free to open them, tweak them, break them, or just mess around however you want. They serve as a solid foundation for building future mods.


Note: If you really canâ€™t stand them, hereâ€™s a simple solution: DESTROY them! ðŸ˜‚ Or better yet, just toss them into the appropriate DisabledMods folder: 
(IMods/DisabledMods or MonoBehaviourMods/DisabledMods) to keep things tidy. Seriously though, if you donâ€™t need them, feel free to discard them â€” but I highly recommend keeping them around as a base for any future mods you might want to create!
